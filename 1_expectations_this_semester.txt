Introduction
I am an aspiring full-stack developer specializing in the MERN tech stack. I have experience with various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, C++, Python, and Golang. On the front end, I have worked with React and used Tailwind CSS for styling. For the back end, I have managed data using Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and have experience with web hosting. However, I have no hands-on experience with back-end development or Node.js, but I am eager to learn. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, apply best practices in development, and become a well-rounded full-stack developer. I also like to explore and try out new emerging technologies.

Course Expectations 
In this course, I want to gain a deep understanding of back-end development, particularly using Node.js, Express.js, NestJS, and MongoDB as the database. My goal is to learn how to handle authentication, build secure and efficient APIs, and effectively manage server-side logic. Additionally, I want to enhance my debugging skills to identify and resolve server-side issues while implementing best practices to ensure scalable and maintainable applications. Learning how to structure back-end code properly, optimize performance, and manage databases efficiently are also key objectives for me.
Back-end development is a crucial skill and an essential step in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer. By mastering back-end concepts, I will be able to create complete, dynamic, and fully functional web applications. Understanding both front-end and back-end technologies will make me a more versatile developer, allowing me to work seamlessly across the entire development stack.
Beyond personal growth, this knowledge will empower me to build small personal projects that solve real-world problems and potentially contribute to open-source projects in the future. I believe that having a strong foundation in back-end development will not only help me advance in my career but also enable me to create impactful and scalable software solutions. Ultimately, my goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer with expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies.

Challenges and Areas for Improvement
One of the challenges I have faced in development is using React hooks, specifically useContext. I believe this is because I haven't used it totally in my projects, making it harder to grasp its full use. Additionally, I find creating logic for complex functions time-consuming, especially when working on complex systems. Structuring my thoughts and breaking down problems into manageable parts is something I want to improve.
Another difficulty I encounter is working with Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and integrating it into my own projects. Understanding how to connect and manage data efficiently can be quite challenging. Moreover, I want to enhance my file and code structure, ensuring that my code follows clean coding principles, making it more readable and maintainable for other developers.
To overcome these challenges, I plan to practice daily and build small projects, as hands-on experience is the most effective way to learn. I will also utilize various resources, including tutorials, official documentation, and community discussions, to deepen my understanding and improve my skills.

Expectations from the Instructor 
I expect my instructor to provide clear explanations of back-end concepts to strengthen my understanding, along with relevant examples that align with our activities or projects. Hands-on projects and real-world applications will greatly enhance my learning experience, allowing me to apply concepts in practical scenarios.
Guidance on best practices, debugging techniques, and efficient problem-solving strategies would be highly beneficial. Additionally, sharing valuable resources such as tutorials and documentation would support my learning journey. I also appreciate interactive lessons, coding exercises, and structured activities, as they help reinforce my skills and make learning more engaging. Overall, I hope for a well-structured and practical approach to mastering back-end development.

Final Thoughts
Learning to be a developer is challenging, especially if you don’t enjoy the process. It’s important to find joy in the journey and stay motivated as we progress. The best way to learn anything, not just programming, is through hands-on experience—learning by doing.
As my instructor mentioned, 50% of our knowledge depends on how we approach learning. It is up to us to put in the effort, practice consistently, and apply what we learn in real projects. By staying engaged and actively participating in the learning process, we can develop our skills more effectively and become better developers over time.
